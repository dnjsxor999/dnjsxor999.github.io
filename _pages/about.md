<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi! I'm a second-year M.S. student in Machine Learning at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by [Dr.Sehoon Ha](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~sha9/). I also received my bachelor's degree in CS at Georgia Tech.

I work at the crossroads of computer graphics and machine learning, studying how reinforcement learning can produce expressive and physically plausible motion behaviors in simulated characters. 

My current research focuses on bridging the gap between human and robotic motion through cross-embodiment generalization and on teaching agents to acquire whole-body dynamic manipulation skills from human demonstrations.

<!-- 아카데믹 톤:
My research lies at the intersection of computer graphics and machine learning, where I explore the use of reinforcement learning to achieve physically realistic motion control for simulated characters. In particular, I am interested in enabling cross-embodiment motion generalization—transferring and adapting human movements to robots of different morphologies—and in developing controllers that can learn whole-body, dynamic manipulation skills directly from human demonstrations. -->
